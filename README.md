# Pi Day 3D ASCII Pie Viewer



## Description

Welcome to my fun little mini-project I made on pi day 2024. I was thinking of what to do and I knew it had to involve three things, pi, pie, and coding. (I realized half way though I should've used PYthon... pi.py would be funny üòµ‚Äçüí´) My original plan was just a regular pie that didn't move, then half way though coding I realized that despite using a bunch of trig and ellipses, I didn't actually use the value pi at all. I changed it up a little and made it into a 3D pie viewer that uses the value of pi to convert from decimals to radians (I like to look at real numbers). I then spend another while making it out of ascii characters. I did by best to use as many constants as possible so all the points, widths, heights, radii, etc can be changed to make your own custom pi size! 

## Features

- Utilizes cutting-edge ASCII artistry to sculpt a lifelike pie.
- Interactive viewing: Rotate the pie horizontally and vertically using keyboard input.
- Classy yet modern: Written in C++ with the same ASCII from 1963, but with contemporary, state-of-the-art ASCII graphics.
- Pi: The pie... is made of œÄs

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DavidHigpen/Pi-Day-2024.git
    ```

2. Open the folder

    ```bash
    cd Pi-Day-2024
    ```

### Usage

1. I'm lazy so I made it easy, you're welcome:

    ```bash
    make run
    ```

2. Use the following keyboard controls to interact with the 3D pie:
   
   - **w** or **s**: Rotate the pie vertically by 10 degrees
   - **a** or **d**: Rotates the pie horizontally (Don't think about it too hard)
   - **exit**: Exit the program

## Plans for pi day 2025?

If I were to add a few more features, I might add steam come off the top and rotate, or have hashes cross the top of the pie as pastry strips. Then I could actually add some horizontal movement!
